If you only need the fuction, download the exe version (64 bit, i don't have 32 bit Windows, sorry) --- single file no installation needed. it's a green software :) 

if you want source code, download puttyCluster.ahk. You need install AutoHotkey to run the script.

for regex syntax, here's reference: http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm

to select windows with different pattern, using (pattern1)|(patern2)|.... , example:

(.*myUser1.*)|(.*host2.*)
